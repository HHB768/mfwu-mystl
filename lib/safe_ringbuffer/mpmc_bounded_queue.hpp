    so, i am just a prompt provider, not a code writer.
    i have read sayings that "It strips away the very thing that makes art human"
    and "If AI erases effort, maybe meaning migrates to our human imperfections
    -- to the beautiful flaws that make us who we are."
    and "The AI is not creating art, it is creating the illusion of art."
    (the last saying is provided by copilot itself ...lol)
    but i feel satisfied with my work, my journey to here, my left todos.
    it is the process that makes me better, not the result.
    when i return here, i will be a better coder (maybe?)
    and i will solve all these todos, with my sincere effort and professional skills.
    lets move to the next project. glhf.
